## About

    We recommend first viewing the .pptx presentation that provides the app context. 

## Instructions for Running Application

1. Clone  .zip file from Github and unzip

2. Run program with an active internet connection to access Firebase content. You can still run it offline but you will only access the core app content that is bundled with the CSV files included in the project.

3.  You **must** run `Math Notation To Language Converter.xcworks` , **not** `Math Notation To Language Converter.xcodeproj` , the first file includes the Firebase cocoa pod dependencies.

4. Due to a genuine IOS bug for showing the InputAccessoryView keyboard in the Simulator, you **must** deselect ‘Connect Hardware Keyboard’ from Hardware -> Keyboard -> ‘Connect Hardware Keyboard’ The math symbol accessory keyboard will then display in the search function above the IOS keyboard.

5. Run app as normal in XCode.
